# weather-dashboard

The challenge was to build a weather dashboard that will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS for the weather in a city typed in.

Using [5 Day Weather Forecast](https://openweathermap.org/forecast5) to retrieve weather data for cities.

## Description

I was provided with basic HTML pages which I had to modify. I also added x 1 javascript file to create a simple daily planner app


Requirements:

* Create a weather dashboard with form inputs.
  * When a user searches for a city they are presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
  * When a user views the current weather conditions for that city they are presented with:
    * The city name
    * The date
    * An icon representation of weather conditions
    * The temperature
    * The humidity
    * The wind speed
  * When a user view future weather conditions for that city they are presented with a 5-day forecast that displays:
    * The date
    * An icon representation of weather conditions
    * The temperature
    * The humidity
  * When a user click on a city in the search history they are again presented with current and future conditions for that city
